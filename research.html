                <h2>Research Interests</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    I am strongly interested in Macroeconomics, particularly in Public Finance, International Trade, 
                    and Climate Change. My expertise also includes Applied Econometrics, particularly using advanced 
                    causal inference techniques to address complex economic issues
                 
                    These cutting-edge methodologies allow me to analyze complex economic issues. 
                    By combining data analysis and Economic theory, I aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of economic phenomena and their policy implications.

                    <li>Balanced Budget Rule and Economic Growth
                       
                            <p>
This paper studies the impact of a Balanced Budget rule (BBR) over the business cycle on economic growth, as adopted in Switzerland’s constitution in 2003. 
First, using a synthetic control method, I find that over the 2003-2018 period, the BBR adoption has been associated with 0.95% higher yearly growth on 
average in Switzerland compared to a counterfactual scenario without BBR. Second, I conduct growth accounting with a neoclassical growth model, finding that 
the increase in Switzerland’s growth is due to the increase in Total Factor Productivity (TFP), which includes institutional changes such as the adoption of the BBR, 
rather than changes in labor or capital accumulation. Third, I build an endogenous growth model with a government making inefficient decisions for political reasons. 
I find that by reducing public debt, the BBR tempers the ”crowding-out effect of debt” and frees up resources for private investment in R&D. Additionally, by reducing 
the service of the debt, it also frees up resources for public investment in R&D. These investments, in turn, foster economic growth through their effect on TFP. 
The model calibrated to Switzerland shows that the long-term yearly growth effect of the BBR is 1.27 basis points, which compounds to a 3% GDP gain after 30 years

In this paper, we first document that climatic or political shocks in an origin country (or exporting country) affect inflation in the destination country (its importing partner) 
through trade among African countries. Second, we demonstrate that existing Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) in Africa have significantly increased trade by 62 to 77 percent from 
1995 to 2019. These figures are lower than most estimates in the literature. We address several issues related to estimating the effects of RTAs, namely the selection bias due to 
many zeros in trade data, their staggered adoption, and their heterogeneous effects across regions. To deal with these issues, we apply a structural gravity model, a Pseudo Poisson 
Maximum Likelihood (PPML) method, and a state-of-the-art event study. Third, after showing evidence that trade transmits shocks across African countries and that RTAs significantly 
increase trade, we develop a theoretical model to discuss the broader implications of regional trade agreements for monetary policy. We use the model to explore how the African 
Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), adopted in 2021, could affect countries' inflation and its implications for their monetary policy.
